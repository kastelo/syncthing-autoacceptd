# Contributing

Contributions in general are welcome, but new features will be accepted
sparingly and on a case-by-case basis. Be sure to file an issue on the
suggested feature beforehand, and get acceptance that the feature is welcome
before spending time on developing it.

Bugfixes and documentation improvements are always welcome without prior
discussion.
